Version 1.0.64: Fix AWB not saving for non-HPOS orders

CRITICAL FIX: AWB Manager now works correctly with traditional WooCommerce orders

Changed from direct WordPress meta functions to WooCommerce order methods:
- get_post_meta() → order->get_meta()
- update_post_meta() → order->update_meta_data() + order->save()
- delete_post_meta() → order->delete_meta_data() + order->save()

Additional improvements:
- Added console logging for debugging AWB operations
- Better error visibility in browser console
- Logs request/response data for troubleshooting

This fix ensures AWB numbers work correctly with:
- Traditional post-based WooCommerce orders (fixed)
- HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage) orders (already working)

Follows WooCommerce 3.0+ best practices for meta data handling.
