# Creating a GitHub Release

To fix the update checker, you need to create a GitHub release. Here's how:

## Method 1: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to: https://github.com/MakiOmar/Aramex-Woocommerce-api-integration
2. Click on "Releases" (on the right side)
3. Click "Create a new release"
4. Set the tag version to: `v1.0.0`
5. Set the release title to: `MO Aramex Shipping Integration v1.0.0`
6. Add release notes:
   ```
   ## Initial Release - MO Aramex Shipping Integration v1.0.0
   
   ### Features:
   - Professional Aramex shipping integration for WooCommerce
   - Bulk shipment creation and management
   - Label printing functionality
   - Rate calculation
   - Order tracking
   - White-labeled for MO
   
   ### Requirements:
   - WordPress 5.3+
   - WooCommerce 3.0+
   - PHP 7.4+
   - SOAP extension
   ```
7. Click "Publish release"

## Method 2: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "MO Aramex Shipping Integration v1.0.0" --notes "Initial release with full Aramex integration features"
```

## Method 3: Using cURL

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/MakiOmar/Aramex-Woocommerce-api-integration/releases \
  -d '{
    "tag_name": "v1.0.0",
    "target_commitish": "master",
    "name": "MO Aramex Shipping Integration v1.0.0",
    "body": "Initial release with full Aramex integration features",
    "draft": false,
    "prerelease": false
  }'
```

## After Creating the Release

Once you create the release, the update checker should work properly. The plugin will be able to:
- Check for new versions
- Display update notifications in WordPress admin
- Allow users to update directly from WordPress

## Testing the Update Checker

1. Go to WordPress Admin â†’ Plugins
2. Look for "MO Aramex Shipping Integration"
3. You should see update information if available
4. Check the "View version details" link to see release information
